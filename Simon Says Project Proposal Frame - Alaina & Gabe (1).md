**1\. App Idea**  
   
     Simon Says is a memory-based button game that challenges players to recall and repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds. The game progresses through a series of rounds, each adding an additional button to memorize. In each round, the system lights up a sequence of buttons, and the player must replicate it in the same order. As the game advances, the sequences become longer and more difficult, testing the player's memory and focus. The game continues until the player makes an error, at which point they must restart from the beginning.

**2\. Target Audience**  
   
     This game is designed for players of all ages, offering an enjoyable and interactive way to improve memory and cognitive recall. It provides an engaging challenge that appeals to individuals looking to enhance their memory retention, attention span, and recollection speed. Whether for casual play or focused mental training, the game fosters both fun and skill development, making it an ideal choice for anyone seeking to sharpen their cognitive abilities in an entertaining and accessible format.

**3\. Goals and Vision**  
   
    Our goal is to develop a visually enhanced version of Simon Says that elevates the gameplay experience through dynamic graphics and intuitive design. By incorporating more vibrant visuals and interactive elements, we aim to not only increase the game's difficulty but also enhance its overall enjoyment and player engagement. This upgraded version will challenge players' memory and focus in new ways, providing a fresh and exciting twist on a classic game, while keeping the core mechanics that make it both fun and educational.
